# Reinforcement Learning II: Q-Learning &  Deep Q-Learning

# Task

## Assignment 1:

You would need to find code for some files to run it successfully. 
Once you are done, understand the code you copied and write a pseudo-code to explain what is happening. 
Write your pseudo-code for the functions:
- __init__
- getQValue
- computeValueFromQValue
- computeActionFromQValues
- getAction
- update

## Assignment 2: 

Create a new map of some other city for the code shared
1. Add a DNN with 1 more FC layer.
2. Your map must have 3 targets A1>A2>A3 and your car/robot/object must target these alternatively. 
3. Train your best model upload a video on YouTube 
4. Answer these questions:
- What happens when "boundary-signal" is weak when compared to the last reward?
- What happens when Temperature is reduced? 
- What is the effect of reducing (gamma)?
